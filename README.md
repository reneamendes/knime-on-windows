# knime-on-windows
The idea here is to have a Knime Analytics Platform on a Windows Server performing some management activities, like:
1) headless execution of Knime workflows
2) management of execution logs
- visualization
- reporting (send logs and a copy of workflow at point of error to the owner)
3) schedule of workflows

Yes, you can do these things and much mode using Knime Community/Busines Hub. But what about you can't pay for these tools ? For instance, here in Brazil the ~US$ 40k of a yearly license of a Basic Knime Business Hub (https://www.knime.com/knime-hub-pricing ) are prohibitive when we need to pay R$ 5.6 for US$ 1 !
