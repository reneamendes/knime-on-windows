# knime-on-windows
The idea here is to have a Knime Analytics Platform on a Windows Server performing some management activities, like:
1) headless execution of Knime workflows
2) management of execution logs
- visualization
- reporting (send logs and a copy of workflow at point of error to the owner)
3) schedule of workflows
