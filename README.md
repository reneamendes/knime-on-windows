# Resources for management of a Knime Analytics Platform headless execution on a Windows Server

The idea here is to have a Knime Analytics Platform on a Windows Server performing some management activities, like:

1) Knime Analytics Platform version management
2) headless execution of Knime workflows
3) execution logs management
- visualization
- reporting (send logs and a copy of workflow at point of error to the owner)
3) workflow versioning control
4) workflow scheduling

Yes, you can do these things and much more using Knime Community/Business Hub. But what about you can't pay for these tools ? For instance, here in Brazil the [~US$ 40k of a yearly license of a Basic Knime Business Hub](https://www.knime.com/knime-hub-pricing) are prohibitive when we need to pay R$ 5.6 for US$ 1 (August/2024)!
